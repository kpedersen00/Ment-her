# Ment-her
Developher 2015 Hackday Project

Connecting employees to potential mentors within their company.

This app is intended to aid in the process of finding relevant mentorship for those seeking assistance.

Users can sign in through LinkedIn and pre-populate their profiles with the corresponding fields from their LinkedIn accounts. In particular, we pull the user's current company to place them in the proper community. Users also have to option to provide additional information such as gender. We then ask the user to specify whether they'd like to volunteer as a mentor, sign up as a mentee, or both.

As a mentor, users will ultimately be able to specify their level of availability, skillset, and other notes they'd like to include.

As a mentee, users will ultimately be able to specify how they'd like to prioritize mentor qualities in their search. For example, if the user is more comfortable with a mentor of a specific gender, or it is important to the user to find a mentor with a certain level of availability, we will preference match results accordingly. As it stands, the user can currently filter search results based on relevant skillset.
